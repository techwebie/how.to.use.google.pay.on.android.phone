* If you already have a card tied to your Google account, or if you’ve used a card to buy an app (or book, film, or so on) on the Play Store, chances are, your card details are likely already accessible from within the Google Pay app. If the card you want to use isn’t yet available on your Android device, then adding one is easy.

* Head into the Google Pay app and tap the ‘Payment’ icon at the bottom of the screen. You’ll then see the option ‘+ Payment method’. Tap it and you’ll be taken to the ‘Add a card’ screen, where you can either scan the credit/debit card you want to add, or enter the relevant details manually.

* Once entered, you’ll need to enter your CVC (the three numbers on the back), confirm the name and address that the card is tied to, and then check your bank’s terms for using your card of choice via Google Pay. Once you’ve accepted said terms, and after a verification step (likely requiring you to enter a code that you can choose to receive via SMS or email), the card will appear in your payment options, ready to go.
